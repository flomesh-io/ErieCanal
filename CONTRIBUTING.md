## Issues

We use Github issues to track public bugs and feature requests.

### Search Known Issues First

Please search the existing issues to see if any similar issue or feature request has already been filed. You should make sure your issue isn't redundant.

### Reporting New Issues

If you open an issue, the more information the better. Such as detailed description, screenshot or video of your problem, logcat or code blocks for your crash.

## Pull Requests

We strongly welcome your pull request to make ErieCanal better.

### Make Pull Requests

The code team will monitor all pull request, we run some code check and test on it. After all tests passed, we will accept this PR. But it won't merge to master branch at once, which have some delay.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. Update code or documentation if you have changed APIs.
3. Add the copyright notice to the top of any new files you've added.
4. Check your code lints and checkstyles.
5. Test and test again your code.
6. Now, you can submit your pull request on dev.
